# My Portfolio

## Description

This is a [portfolio](https://hannazo.github.io/my-portfolio/) page that showcases my latest projects. 

It was built with html and advanced css.  

Appearance:
It is not exactly like the mock-up provided. I chose a simple minimalistic design with muted tones that represents my style best and added/changed elements to create a portfolio page that I wanted. 

Functionality:
- Fixed navigation bar with developer's name on the left and navigation links on the right
- Functional navigation links: home, about, portfolio and contact
- Hero section with a welcome message and a job title
- About section with a general description, recent photo and a button to open a resume
- Portfolio section with five sample projects
- Each project has a title, short description and a link to deployed application
- Featured project's image is larger than other projects
- Contact section with contact information and a contact form
- Footer with links to social media accounts and copyright text
- Responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes

** Please note that placeholder text, images and sample portfolio were used and will be updated later as I go through the course
